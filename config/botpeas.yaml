### BotPEASS Configuration Settings

# Search & Filtering Behavior
ALL_VALID: no

# Set your primary scope of CVE's to include for notifications
# Configure this as one of: all_cves, all_keywords, products
#   - all_cves:       every CVE in the results will be sent as a message
#   - all_keywords:   All CVE's matching your defined keywords will be sent (including products)
#   - products:       Only CVE's matching your defined products, but you get all of them, regardless of keywords
SEARCH_SCOPE: products

# -- Include High-Severity CVE's Always --
# Expand your search scope to also include high-severity CVE's
# NOTE: Out of caution, if enabled, bot will also include all CVE's for which no score exists yet, so we don't
# miss a hot new CVE that just doesn't yet have a score assigned.
#     True:         enabled
#     threshold:    all CVE's with CVSS score equal to or higher are included
INCLUDE_HIGH_SEVERITY: True
HIGH_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD: 9.5

# -- Exclude Low-Severity CVE's Always --
# Enable including only matched keywords if CVE is also a high CVSS score (reduce noise of low-severity CVE's)
# Disclaimer: If enabled, this means you will not see CVE's for which the CVSS score is currently blank
ENABLE_SCORE_FILTERING: True
MIN_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 5.0

# -- MITRE Exploit-DB -- Update dataset every 'n' days
MITRE_INTERVAL: 3

# -- EPSS Score Lookups --
ENABLE_EPSS_LOOKUPS: True

# -- Exclusion Filtering --
# If present, exclude CVE from results
# NOTE: Case Sensitive!
